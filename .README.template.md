### repository

the latest "automatic" (me copying over sftp manually) release is always on https://juke.fr

```bash
$ git clone https://code.juke.fr/kay/juke-fr.git

$ npm i

$ npm dev
```

### test suite

playwright is used for testing

```bash
$ npm test:setup # only needed once to download the browsers

$ npm test
```

playwright is cool because it gives you traces with screenshots you can go through step by step so yeah

### tested upgrade

the test suite can be used with npm-check-updates to mass upgrade the node modules and make sure stuff still (at least somewhat) works

```bash
$ npm tested-upgrade
```

it will upgrade all the packages then run the test and do them one by one incrementally if that fails and not do any of the ones that makes the tests fail
