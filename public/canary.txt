what have you stumbled uppon?

this is just a little file that i keep on here and try to update and sign as often as possible
to let everybody know that none of the above has happened yet (so the longer ago it was done the less trustworthy it is that none of this has happened)

how do you verify any of this?

this uses pgp keys for signing so please make sure you have something like gpg installed on your system
then you import our key (you can find it online and we have some fingerprints distributed on places like our social media profiles/bios so you can check that we are at least the person behind control of these accounts)

gpg --recv-keys 2d30a1a4b44e753357abee8dec084914605964dc

then you can verify the canary file by running

gpg --verify canary.txt

it should tell you that the signature is good, if not the thing was tampered with
