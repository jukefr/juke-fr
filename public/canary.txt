hello this is the new canary starting on 18th june 2023
i dont know what happened to the last one or my previous keys but thats up to you to decide ultimately

heres some links from around the time this canary was made

i have not been asked by any feds (or fed associated entity or gvt etc etc) be they french or from anywhere else any data or anything
i have never given any of my data to feds (etc etc) or it been seized
no whatever the french equivalent to a subpoena has be served nor complied to
no backdoors were installed by us

from now on this canary will be signed with this new key, the fingerprint of which has been spread as best we could for now
if there are any further changes in key we will use the old one to first sign the new ones fingerprint in a warning canary
we might also find the old keys that we used to use and make a quick proof with it at some point in the near future

that is all thank you

what have you stumbled uppon?

this is just a little file that i keep on here and try to update and sign as often as possible
to let everybody know that none of the above has happened yet (so the longer ago it was done the less trustworthy it is that none of this has happened)

how do you verify any of this?

this uses pgp keys for signing so please make sure you have something like gpg installed on your system
then you import our key (you can find it online and we have some fingerprints distributed on places like our social media profiles/bios so you can check that we are at least the person behind control of these accounts)

gpg --recv-keys 2d30a1a4b44e753357abee8dec084914605964dc

then you can verify the canary file by running

gpg --verify canary.txt

it should tell you that the signature is good, if not the thing was tampered with
